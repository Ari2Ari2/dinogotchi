_Ideas for future versions of Dinogotchi._

# Introduction #

Although for now Dinogotchi is going to be a simple clone, eventually I want to create a feature rich application including networked multiplayer support and an environment to roam around in.

_**Note: These ideas are not in order of importance or any kind of order other than the order I think of them.  They will be put in order later.**_

# Ideas #


---

Once the initial clone has been made then I would like to expand and have some sort of growth pattern for the dinogotchi to follow:

egg > baby > adolescence > adulthood > eventual death.

I would like the growth of the dinogotchi to be determined by the way that the user has interacted with it.

---


I would like to integrate some sort of personality for each individual dinogotchi, again this will be determined by the way the user interacts with the pet.

---


Networking support, one users dinogotchi can connection to another users dinogotchi and interact with it in interesting ways.  Integration compatibility between two dinogotchis would be determined by their personality.

---


Mating of dinogotchis.  Trait of the parents would be "genetically" transfered into the new baby dinogotchi.

---


An interactive, dynamic environments which determines aspects of your dinogotchis look and personality.
