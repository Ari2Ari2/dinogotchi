_Ideas for future versions of Dinogotchi.

= Introduction =

Although for now Dinogotchi is going to be a simple clone, eventually I want to create a feature rich application including networked multiplayer support and an environment to roam around in.

_*Note: These ideas are not in order of importance or any kind of order other than the order I think of them.  They will be put in order later.* _

= Ideas =

One the initial clone has been made then I would like to expand and have some sort of growth pattern for the dinogotchi to follow:

egg > baby > adolescence > adulthood > eventual death.

I would like the growth of the dinogotchi to be determined by the way that the user has interacted with it.
