_introduction to dinogotchi_

= Introduction =

Dinogotchi is a play on the name of the original tamagotchi.  Tamagotchi is two Japanese words combined: tamago which means egg and then tomodachi which means friend.  So essentially Dinogotchi means Dinosaur friend.

This project is still very much in it's infancy.  No code has been written yet.  Although eventually I want many features for dinogotchi(see future ideas), I want to keep it simple for now so initially I will be aiming to recreate the original tamagotchi game play.  In fact dinogotchis gameplay will be simpler than the tamagotchis at the beginning.  

Dinogotchis states will be limited.
